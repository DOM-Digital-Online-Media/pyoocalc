Usage

Starting OpenOffice / LibreOffice

PyLibreTM requires a running OpenOffice or LibreOffice instance which it can
connect to. On Ubuntu you can start LibreOffice from a command line using a 
command similar to:

$ soffice --accept="socket,host=localhost,port=2002;urp;" \
--norestore --nologo --nodefault # --headless

The LibreOffice will be listening for localhost connection on port 2002.
Alternatively a named pipe can be used:

$ soffice --accept="pipe,name=hello;urp;" --norestore --nologo\
 --nodefault # --headless

If the --headless option is used then no user interface is visible even when a
document is opened.

For more information run:

$ soffice --help
It is recommended to start directly the soffice binary. There can be various 
scripts (called for example libreoffice) which will run the soffice binary but 
you may not get the correct PID of the running program.
